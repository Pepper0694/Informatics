# If you are not using the `Assignments` tab on the course JupyterHub server to read this notebook, read [Activating the assignments tab](https://github.com/lcdm-uiuc/info490-sp17/blob/master/help/act_assign_tab.md).
# 
# A few things you should keep in mind when working on assignments:
# 
# 1. Make sure you fill in any place that says `YOUR CODE HERE`. Do **not** write your answer in anywhere else other than where it says `YOUR CODE HERE`. Anything you write anywhere else will be removed or overwritten by the autograder.
# 
# 2. Before you submit your assignment, make sure everything runs as expected. Go to menubar, select _Kernel_, and restart the kernel and run all cells (_Restart & Run all_).
# 
# 3. Do not change the title (i.e. file name) of this notebook.
# 
# 4. Make sure that you save your work (in the menubar, select _File_  â†’ _Save and CheckPoint_)
# 
# 5. You are allowed to submit an assignment multiple times, but only the most recent submission will be graded.

# ## Number of Flights from ORD
# In this problem, we are going to make a graph showing the number of flights from the `ORD` airport to all other airports using `~/data/2001/2001-1.csv`, which includes top 500,000 lines of our familiar `~/data/2001.csv` file. For this problem, only the two columns, `Origin` and `Dest`, are needed. Since we only care about flights departed from `ORD`, we could remove irrelavant rows from the dataframe. (In principle, we could make a graph of airline connections between all airports in the data; here we choose origin to be `ORD` just for simplicity.)

# In[2]:

filename = '/home/data_scientist/data/2001/2001-1.csv'
flights = pd.read_csv(filename, header=0, na_values=['NA'], usecols=(16, 17)).dropna()

# remove all rows whose origin is not ORD
from_ord = flights.loc[flights['Origin']=='ORD'].dropna()
print(from_ord.tail(20))


# ### get_top_dests
# - Write a function named `get_top_dests` that counts the number of flights from `ORD` to each destination in the input dataframe and returns top `n` destinations together with the count of each destination. 
# - Each row of the input dataframe corresponds to one flight (one count). For example, 
# ```
# 497123    ORD  IAH
# 497124    ORD  IAH
# 497125    ORD  IAH
# ```
# should add 3 counts for `IAH`.
# - While there might be various ways to do the counting and selection, the most straight forward method that gives you the desired output form is to use `Counter`.

# ### create_flights_graph
# - Write a function named `create_flights_graph` that takes the top destinations (result from previous function in the form of a list of (`Dest`, count)) and creates a networkx Graph.
# - Step through each destination airport to add egdes to the Graph. Note that nodes will be automatically added when you add edges. The edges connect destinations to `ORD`.
# - For each edge, you should add a normalized weight (use `'weight'` as the key) which equals to the int value of count devided by the minimum count. We'll use weights of edges later when we draw the Graph.

# ## Common Movie Interests between 30 Users
# In this problem, we are going to examine the common movie interests between first 30 users in `~/data/ml-latest-samll/ratings.csv` with `userId` from 1 to 30. If a user has given a rating equal to or above 4.0 points for a movie, we say that the user is interested in the movie. The following cell reads the csv file into a dataframe, and then do a selection based on these conditions (`rating`>=40 and `userId` from 1 to 30). 

# In[47]:

filename2 = '/home/data_scientist/data/ml-latest-small/ratings.csv'
movies = pd.read_csv(filename2, header=0, usecols=(0, 1, 2)).dropna()

# name the selected dataframe as 'good_movies'
good_movies = movies[(movies['rating']>=4.0)&(movies['userId'].isin(np.arange(1, 31)))][['userId', 'movieId']]
print(good_movies.head(10))


# In the selected dataframe `good_movies`, we say there's one common movie interest between two users if they both have rating records for the same movie in `good_movies`. For example, if `userId` 1 and `userId` 2 have both rated `movieId` 16, then we add one count to the common movie interests between user 1 and user 2. We'll make make a plot of common movie interests based on this definition.
# 
# ### get_top_pairs
# - Write a function named `get_top_pairs` that counts the number of common movie interests between any combination of two users in the input dataframe and returns top n paired users together with the count of numbers of common movies.
# - As mentioned above, we add one count of common movies to a user pair if the two users in the pair have rated the same movie. For example, suppose we have these lines in `good_movies`,
# ```
#     userId  movieId
# 0        1       16
# 2        1       32
# 3        2       16
# 4        2       32
# ```
# then row 0 and 3 should contribute to one count for user pair (`userId` 1, `userId` 2), and row 2 and 4 add another count for user pair (`userId` 1, `userId` 2); thus, the total counts for user pair (`userId` 1, `userId` 2) is 2 from these four lines.
# - Use `combinations` as iterators to make pairs, so that user pair (`userId` 1, `userId` 2) is considered identical as user pair (`userId` 2, `userId` 1), and only (`userId` 1, `userId` 2) is included in the result.
# - While there might be various ways to do the counting and selection, the most straight forward method that gives you the desired output form is to use Counter.
# - Note that this time, the output is a list of tuples (paired_users, count/number of occurrence) 
#     in the form of (tuple, int), 
#     i.e. a list of tuples(user1, user2, count/number of occurrence)
#     in the form of (int, int, int). In the given example of the four lines, the output is `[(1, 2), 2]`. You'll automatically get this form using Counter.
