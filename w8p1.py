# If you are not using the `Assignments` tab on the course JupyterHub server to read this notebook, read [Activating the assignments tab](https://github.com/lcdm-uiuc/info490-sp17/blob/master/help/act_assign_tab.md).
# 
# A few things you should keep in mind when working on assignments:
# 
# 1. Make sure you fill in any place that says `YOUR CODE HERE`. Do **not** write your answer in anywhere else other than where it says `YOUR CODE HERE`. Anything you write anywhere else will be removed or overwritten by the autograder.
# 
# 2. Before you submit your assignment, make sure everything runs as expected. Go to menubar, select _Kernel_, and restart the kernel and run all cells (_Restart & Run all_).
# 
# 3. Do not change the title (i.e. file name) of this notebook.
# 
# 4. Make sure that you save your work (in the menubar, select _File_  â†’ _Save and CheckPoint_)
# 
# 5. You are allowed to submit an assignment multiple times, but only the most recent submission will be graded.

# ## Get email info
# In this function, you will write a function to do the following things:
# - Open an email, given a datapath
# - Return who the message was to, who it was from, and the subject line.
# - If "key" is true, then also return a list of keys. If "key" is false, an empty list is returned instead.

# ## Many Payloads
# Now, we want to grab many emails from the same directory so that we can perform analysis and training on them later. This function should take four arguments: a string called "path" that states the base directory that you want to extract all of your payloads from, two integers, stating on which number message to start and stop at, inclusive, and a boolean that states if you want to look at ham or spam.  You should use os.walk(). For example, if beg = 50 and end = 75, you should iterate through the 50th message through the 75th, inclusive. 

# In[4]:

def many_payloads(path, beg, end, ham = True):
    '''

    and appends the payloads into a list called payloads.

    ----------
    path: A string

# ## Convert to arrays
# In order to use scikit learn, we need to convert our ham and spam arrays to numpy arrays (pos_emails and neg_emails), and then create label arrays for each previous list (spam or ham) where the ham label array (pos_labels) should be filled with ones and be the length of pos_emails, and the spam label array (neg_labels) should be filled with zeros and be the length of the neg_emails.

# ## Training and testing sets
# In order to perform some analysis on this data, we need to split and then contatenate the pos_emails and neg_emails together (and do the same for the pos_labels and neg_labels) so as to create a training and testing array for both X and y.  The "split" variable will tell you where to split your arrays.  For example, If split is 300, the training set will consist of the first 300 emails in pos_emails plus the first 300 emails in neg_emails, and the rest of the emails go into the test set.  The same will be true for the label arrays.
